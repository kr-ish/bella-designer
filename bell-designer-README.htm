<P>  The 3F bell designer is inspired by Jean-Claude Risset's early insight that
the inharmonic spectra of bells can be considered as chords and used as material
for musical composition; chords and spectra are only different manifestations of
a single phenomenon.  Risset's early description of a computer music "bell"
sound is widely available now (for instance in Dodge and Jerse, <I>Computer
Music</I>) as are his writings about the use of inharmonic spectra in
composition.

<P> Another inspiration is Philippe Manoury's piece, <i>Jupiter</i>, in
which, in sections 6 and 12, an oscillator bank plays frequencies that are
derived from theoretical FM spectra given various carrier and modulation
frequencies.  This technique also strives to generate believable and listenable
spectra from generating frequencies provided by a composer or other musician.

<P> The 3F bell designer attempts to choose partials to make up an inharmonic
spectrum that carries an internal harmony controlled by specifying three
component pitches, so that the spectra so created will mix pleasingly with
harmonic, instrumental sounds played at those pitches.  The three pitches are
converted into frequencies (call them f, g, and h) whose linear combinations
(f+g, f-2g+3h, etc) become a spectrum.  Because spectra created in this way can
easily become overly dense, a random percentage (between 3 and 100 percent) of
these frequencies are chosen, counting upward from low-order combinations to
higher-order ones, until a fixed number of frequencies is obtained.

<P> Although the original three pitches themselves will not in general be
prominent in the mixture, they will occur in many possible ways as the
difference between two frequencies in the calculated spectrum; this is what
makes the resulting sounds fit in with the original pitches, despite the very
inharmonic nature of the resulting sounds.

<P> The patch runs in Pd version 0.41 or newer. Select an output level (the dB
control in the output~ box, top right; set to 70 or 80 to start with). Then
click on any of the "examples" boxes and you should hear the sounds.

<P> To make your own sounds, enter numbers for the five parameters, named pit1,
pit2, pit3, prob, and seed.  The first three specify (in MIDI units) the three
frequencies from which to build the spectra.  The "prob" parameter controls the
probability of hearing any individual calculated component, in percent; if set
at 100, the first 16 computed partials will be taken, if 50, each one will be
taken with probability 1/2 (and other, later candidates will be taken to arrive
at 16 components in all).  The "seed" is 0 or a positive number.  If it is
positive, it will seed the random choices so that the same spectrum comes out
each time; if zero, the seed will be replaced randomly each time.

<P> To actually make the sound, either click on the "trigger" button or turn on
the "auto" toggle, so that any changes in parameters automatically recalculate
and replay the spectrum.

<P> The toggle "hear pitches" at center top allows you to hear the three
component frequencies; these should be reminiscent of the "bell" sounds but at
the same time very different.

<P> A pair of pitch shifters is provided to soften the sounds up -- you'll need
this if you are spending more than a couple of minutes searching for sounds. 
They are turned on by default.
